# Dockerfile for Landing Page (Standalone)
# Note: This assumes you are building the Next.js app but only serving the landing page routes.
# If you meant a completely separate React app, that would require a different structure.
# Since this is a Next.js app with App Router, we deploy the whole app but focus on the landing route.
